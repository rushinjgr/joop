# README

This repository is:
* designed to support multi-language development, with a primary focus on Python. 
* inspired in part by:
  * the need for an OOP framework to define web endpoints and data access objects acrosss projects.
  * the fact that the ability to render a data model (ex. a SQLModel) to a web browser in a simple way is a killer feature.
  * an appreciation of HTMX and/or AlpineJS in the right contexts.
  * the (until now) unavailability of an existing OOP framework or paradigm that checked these boxes.

For detailed information about the Python implementation, refer to the `python/README.md` file.
